# House-Flipping
This program reads in a user entered house image, flips it, and prints that mirror image. Assume that the house images will be of a maximum of 500 lines, with a maximum of 500 characters each.
Assume that all the lines will be of equal length. Assume that spaces, #, , + and -produce the same character (itself) upon
mirroring, but [ becomes ], and vice versa; and / becomes\, and vice versa.
